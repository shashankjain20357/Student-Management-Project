Creating a student management system using Spring Boot microservices, Angular for the frontend, and MySQL as the database is a common project in web application development. Here are the high-level steps you can follow to implement such a system:

 

1. **Project Setup:**

   - Set up a Spring Boot project for the backend using Spring Initializer.

   - Create an Angular project for the frontend using the Angular CLI.

 

2. **Database Setup:**

   - Set up a MySQL database for storing student-related data. Design the database schema, including tables for students, courses, and any other relevant information.

 

3. **Backend Development:**

   - Create Spring Boot microservices for various functionalities. For example:

     - Student Service: CRUD operations for students.

     - Course Service: CRUD operations for courses.

     - Enrolment Service: Handling student course enrolment.

   - Use Spring Data JPA to interact with the MySQL database.

   - Implement RESTful APIs for each microservice.

 

4. **Frontend Development (Angular):**

   - Create Angular components for student management:

     - Student List: Display a list of students.

     - Student Details: View and edit student details.

     - Course List: Display a list of courses.

     - Enrolment: Enrol students in courses.

   - Use Angular services to consume the backend REST APIs.

   - Implement routing to navigate between different views.

 

5. **User Authentication (Optional):**

   - Implement user authentication and authorization using technologies like Spring Security for the backend and Angular Guard for the frontend.
